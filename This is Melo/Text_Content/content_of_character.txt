Track 1 – Content of Character
Intro
I ain’t known for the noise, I’m known for the root
The echo of truth, not the hype in the suit
They build for applause, I build for the after
That’s the sound of the content of character
Verse 1
It ain’t in your followers, not in your drip
Not in the edits, the angle, the script
It’s in how you speak when the lights are gone
In how you stand when the world feels wrong

It’s in your no when yes would sell
In what you hide, in what you tell
It's the mirror you face when the wins go dry
The code you live by, not the alibi

My morals ain’t rented, my truth ain’t a mask
My ethics don’t shift just to finish the task
I’m not what I post, I’m not what they see
I’m the silence that speaks when I just let me be

No filter on peace, no gimmick on grace
Just content of character, raw in its place
Hook
What I got — you can’t fake that
Morals, dreams — I don’t chase that
Truth, respect — yeah I shape that
Peace inside — can’t replace that

Content of character — I stay that
Content of character — I lay that
That’s my map, my code, my path
Walk beside me — don’t look back
Verse 2
I disappeared just to find what’s real
Cut the world off — let my spirit heal
In the silence, I met my breath
And in that stillness, I embraced death

Not to fear it, but to wear it calm
Mortality — my rhythm, my psalm
I saw the end, then I saw the start
My identity collecting parts. 

No legacy worth if the roots ain’t clean
No journey worth if the path ain’t seen
It’s what you’re about and where you going? 
The journey paved with depth and meaning 

The answer came like the morning breeze
No louder than a whisper from the trees
“You’re walking toward the Home of Peace”
That’s when my doubts began to cease
Bridge
Lā ilāha illa Allāh…
Lack of faith in humanity — and the operative word is faith.

We put our trust in rate,
In speed, in screens, in clickbait.
We chase the high, obey the pace,
But we don’t pause to contemplate.

Faith isn’t gone.
It’s just being redirected.
Automated.
Replicated.

Do you want control —
or remain sedated?

Lā ilāha illa Allāh…
Hook (Repeat)
What I got — you can’t fake that
Morals, dreams — I don’t chase that
Truth, respect — yeah I shape that
Peace inside — can’t replace that

Content of character — I stay that
Content of character — I lay that
That’s my map, my code, my path
Walk beside me — don’t look back
